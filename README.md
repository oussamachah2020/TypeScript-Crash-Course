**TypeScript!!!!!**

. Offers additional features to JavaScript including static types
. Using types is completely **optional**
. Compiles down to regular JS
. Can be used for front-end JS as well as backend with NodeJs
. Includes most features from ES6, ES7 (classes, arrow functions, etc)
. Types from 3rd party libraries can be added with **type definition**

**`Dymanic` vs `Static Typing`**

In **dynamic typed language**, the types are assiociated with run-time values and not named explicitly in your code

In **statically typed languages**, you explicitly assign types to variables function parameters, return values, etc
